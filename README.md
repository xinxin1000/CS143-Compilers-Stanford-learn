# COOL Compiler
c++ version for CS143 COOL compiler assigment 
* CS143 is a Stanford online course. It is open on Stanford Lagunita platform when I take it, but it is going to be closed and may be changed to [another paltform](http://online.stanford.edu.).
* For the environment setup, I used the pre-configured linux system provided by the course via virtualbox. This is friendly for people not quite familiar with linux ;) 
* Only files modified are uploaded.
* I refered a lot to [skyluoz's](https://github.com/skyzluo/CS143-Compilers-Stanford) and [dfridman1's](https://github.com/dfridman1/CS143-Compilers-Stanford) amazing work, tried to understand their code and added some my thought.
* All 4 assignment should get full mark.
* The last assignment needs knowledge about assembly language. I am still not quite clear about some register operation in it, but at least the whole logic can be understood.
